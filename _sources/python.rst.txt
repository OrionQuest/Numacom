Getting Started with Python
===========================

In the previous chapter, we made casual references to `Python
<https://www.python.org/>`_ in several places, assuming the reader was already
familiar with the basics. The author's aim was to dive right into scientific
computing to give the reader a taste of the field.  With that out of our way
now, this chapter aims to provide a refresher course to `Python
<https://www.python.org/>`_ for all beginners. We will cover all the different
concepts and language traits that will be used throughout in later chapters.
This chapter is intentionally agnostic to a particular `operating system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system>`_
or `text editor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor>`_, as these things
are always in flux and everyone has different preferences.
