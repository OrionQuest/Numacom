Introduction
============

This section gives a broad overview of the concepts from linear algebra that
will be used throughout the course. It is intended as a review of background
material. While most students may already be familiar with these
topics, they are still encouraged to briefly skim through the material
so as to take note of all the programming concepts that are introduced.

We will be working almost exclusively with the set :math:`\mathbb R` of all `real numbers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number>`_. In particular, we will
consider the *Cartesian product* of two sets :math:`A` and :math:`B` defined as:

.. math::
    A\times B = \{(a,b) : a\in A \mbox{ and } b\in B\}

The Cartesian product can be used to define *powers* of sets as follows:

.. math::
    A^n = \underbrace{A \times A\times \ldots \times A}_{n \mbox{ times}}

.. toctree::
    :hidden:
    :maxdepth: 2

    Vectors  <vectors>
    Matrices <matrices>
