Vector and Matrix Algebra
=========================

In most real world applications, instead of operating on just a single number,
numerical computation is performed on an entire set of numbers. Vector and
matrix algebra provides a convenient way to conceptualize the resulting
computations into a clean mathematical framework. This chapter provides an
overview of vectors and matrices, along with some examples of their usage in
practice.
