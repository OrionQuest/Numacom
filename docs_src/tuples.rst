Tuples
------

:ref:`sec-lists` allow storage of items that can change over time. However,
sometimes the developer requires a list that remains constant over time.
`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ defines *tuples* to accommodate this need.
Objects that remain constant over time are referred to as *immutable* in `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_.
Thus, a tuple can be defined as an *immutable list*.
