``if/else`` Statements
----------------------

`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ provides ``if/else`` statements to support conditional branching,
similar to other high-level languages. An ``else`` block is not mandatory,
although similar to ``for`` loops, all statements within the ``if`` block
should be indented.
