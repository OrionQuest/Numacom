CS323: Numerical Analysis and Computing
=======================================

Welcome to CS 323! This course is an introduction to the broad field of numerical
algorithms, optimization, and differential equations. Real-world examples from
different fields such as computer vision, machine learning, and data analysis will
be given alongside each topic to illustrate the wide applicability of the various
methods discussed in class. This course is heavy on programming, with the aim of
implementing most of the algorithms discussed in class. We will be using
`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ along with its scientific computing packages
`NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ and `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_. While
there are many excellent resources available on the web, the following `lecture
notes <http://www.scipy-lectures.org/>`_ are particularly recommended. Of
course, we will be covering all the basics in class on an as needed basis. There is
**no required text** for this course, although some recommendations are given below.

| **Time:** 5PM - 8PM, Tuesdays, Fall 2017
| **Place:** Lucy Stone Hall Auditorium

| **Instructor:** `Mridul Aanjaneya <http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~aanjneya>`_
| **Office:** CBIM 18
| **Office hours:** Monday/Friday (4PM - 5PM)

| **TA:** Carlos Muniz
| **Office:** TBD
| **Office hours:** Thursday (5PM - 6PM) and also by appointment

| **TA:** Mihee Lee
| **Office:** TBD
| **Office hours:** TBD

**Email Policy:** You are welcome to email the instructor about class-related
issues. Please start your subject line with \"**CS 323:**\". However, please do
not always count on an immediate reply. Although most questions will be answered
quickly, in the worst case you will receive a reply during (or shortly after)
the instructors' *next* scheduled office hours. It is also recommended to post
homework-related questions on `Piazza <https://piazza.com/class/j76v13g42b15y8>`_ instead of emailing the
instructor so that other fellow students can benefit from it.

**Grading Policy:** Grades will be awarded based on class participation, bi-weekly homeworks, two 75
minute in-class midterms and an **optional final**. The final grade will be computed as follows:

    55% x (homework grade) + 20% x (midterm1) + 20% x (midterm2) + 5% x (class participation)

**Final:** The final exam will have two parts, the first part corresponding to the
syllabus of midterm1, and the second part corresponding to the syllabus of
midterm2. When computing your
final grade, we will consider the **best** of the final and the corresponding
midterm score. This means that you can choose to *replace* either your score for midterm1,
or midterm2, or both by taking the final exam. However, if you do not perform
well in the final, your previous midterm scores will be used.

**Class participation:** Participation in class will be
evaluated based on the number of classes attended, enthusiasm for answering the
instructor's questions, and willingness to help other students, both in person
and also online in the discussion forum. Extra credit points can also be earned
by helping the instructor improve his set of lecture notes. :-)

**Homework:** Students are encouraged to collaborate with each other on homework
problems in teams of size at most 3. However, they must individually turn in
their solutions and also mention the names of their collaborators on their
homework. Note that no two people can collaborate with each other on more than
two homeworks. We will not consider the lowest homework score when evaluating your
final grade. Homework problems will be posted every second week on this webpage,
and will be due at **midnight** on the Tuesday lecture two weeks later. Each
student is also granted **3 late days** total for submitting their homeworks.
After this grace period has expired (either for the current homework or from
previous homeworks) we will subtract 15% for each day that is delayed further.
